		<p>Flowers, also known as blooms and blossoms, are the reproductive structures of flowering plants (angiosperms). Typically, they are structured in four circular levels, called whorls, around the end of a stalk. These whorls include: calyx, modified leaves; corolla, the petals; androecium, the male reproductive unit consisting of stamens and pollen; and gynoecium, the female part, containing style and stigma, which receives the pollen, and ovary, which contains the ovules. When arranged in groups, with or without modified leaves, they are known collectively as inflorescences.

		<p>A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (/ˈroʊzə/),[4] in the family Rosaceae (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),[4] or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.[5] They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.[6] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through pinks, reds, oranges and yellows. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and Northwest Africa.[6] Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height.[6] Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.</p>
